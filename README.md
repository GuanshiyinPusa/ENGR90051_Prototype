# ENGR90051 Website prototype
- Install streamlit using pip and run prop11.py. EZ! Just put the images you want for card back/front in the folders.
- Cooked the prototype using streamlit in one hour in class(they don't teach real stuff. I remembered the tutor was taking about how to purge some of the ideas generated during brainstorm. Bruh, you know you talking to college graduates right?)
- Got 3 functions - Gatcha system (draw 3 random cards from the card pool -> card is transferred in to credit -> use credit to purchase stuff)
- Good Idea (in case anyone in future class sees this) The project is about reducing e-waste in campus, and you gotta consider all the stakeholders. The un-dodgeable question is that, what is the school getting out of it? The answer is that they put those out of date monitors and stuff in the web store we created, thus reduce their expenditure on purchasing incentives.

## PS
- One of the worst subject that I have ever learned in Unimelb. (Basically an English course for international students -- they taught you public speech+discussion+presentation+interactive discussion(I had to do some rehearsals with my team to pull that off, pff))
- The tutors claimed that they wanted the students to be qualifed to be real life engineerings. But their linkedin basically shows they have **ZERO** experience in their industry. Teaching team is basically nepo babies + DEI.
- One of the tutor Zoey started her teaching career in Unimelb with the bias that "Local White students always do better than international students." What a great start! Let's cheer for her. She is Chinese btw, even more pathetic.

## Sounded like you got an option on product to deliver but U don't
- 80% people built website (That's why they assigned teams because they need an Software Engineering/EE students in each team).
- 10% made pesudo website
- 10% EE students used arduino to make some gadgets(respect!)

## Shit team mates
- one of the team mates is like upside down fish 90% of the time. But back to life during real assessment EVERYTIME.(adderall???)
