# ENGR90051 Website prototype
- One of the worst subject that I have ever learned. (Basically an English course for international students -- they taught you public speech+discussion+presentation)
- The tutors claimed that they want the students to be qualifed to be real life engineerings. But their linkedin basically shows they have **ZERO** experience in their industry.
- One of the tutor Zoey started her career in Unimelb with the bias that "Local White students do better than international students." BOOOOOOOOOOOO!

## Sounded like you got an option on product to deliver but U don't
- 80% people built website (That's why they assign teams because they need an Software Engineering students in each team).
- 10% make pesudo website
- 10% EE students use arduino to make some gadgets.

## Shit team mates
- one of the team mates is like upside down fish 90% of the time. But back to life during real assessment.(adderall???)
