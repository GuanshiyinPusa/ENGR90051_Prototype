Tier reward system
The specific scenario where your prototype will be used. 

The user put enough electronic components in the system and got enough credits
of a tier, then the user can draw cards.

Steps:
The students bring the electrnoic components to school or TCS or e-waste bin for
recycle. 

The staff can log their contribution into the tier reward system under the
students account.

When the students reward system reaches certain points at the tier reward systm.
They can draw card from the system and get some rewards to be claimed.

Online system that connects to the student account -- my.unimelb. Different
electronic components can be transferred into different points. For example,
resistors are 1 points, the PCB is 10 points, and the computer is 1000 points.
The points system will be reevaluated every year to make sure it is incentive to
students for recycling them.
