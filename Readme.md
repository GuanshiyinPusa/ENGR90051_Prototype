Install streamlit use the cmd in powershell/bash/mac's bash

Everytime a draw card is clicked. It is reshuffled first, then the system pick

#### Looking at other people's account

#### Rework on the points progress bar. I see what i can do.

#### Find funny pics? I reckon, EE guys asking others for opinions
the code resize the image, so sth like a phone vertical photo, or phone wallapper size

#### Ask around for testing~

Gonna use Ai in code and picture gen

#### Points assignment:
Katja was asking this during the class. 
Resistor is like 1 point and PC is like 1000 points. PCB is like 10 to 100,
varies depends on size. 
I reckon it would the TCS staff/bin to evaluate based on the points system we
designed. And we gonna say like they can change it every year/sms to make sure
the right points, that said, 1000 may be not so incentive to students to bring
them to TCS
