I want to have several web pages for my card drawing system. This is for setting
up a rewards system for students recycling e-waste in university of Melbourne.

The main page should include the progress bar in the top middle which tells you how much points
you got with the card drawing part right below it.
The drawing card system will read from the folder -- cards/, inside, there is
back.png, which is the back of a card, and then fronts/ which includes three
type of cards folder -- common/, rare/, and legendary/. 

I will have the images for those in png form. The system will read as many png
from the folder as the card.

Each of these folders We got a side bar that is extendable and incudes three options -- Profile --
change for credit -- rewards, each relates to one page. below them is the prompt
message, saying how many cards are loaded, how many common, rare and legendary
cards.

Every 100 points on the progress bar will allow the student to draw the card in
the card drawing part, there will be three cards that is locked with the card
pool, they will only draw cards from the designated card pool, which the first
slot is locked in common, the second slot is locked in common and rare, and the
third is locked with rare and legendary. 

Profile page:
The profile page, will include the student name, id and email address, and a
past history of things recycled. You can make a fake name and everything, for
the things recycled, you can make up things that is electronic engineering
students related, for example, bread board, resisters. You gonna have a number
on the things. There is no image, so just a table, for example, resisters --
100. there will also be a card drawn list, which they can see what cards they
have drawn from the card pool.

Change for credit page:
This page will allow the school staff to key in the points that the students
recycled. I will give you an image of fake QR code and below is an input box, if
a number is keyed inside it, it will be added to the progress bar on the main
page.

Rewards:
The user can see the top right there is another independent credit system which
records how much points they are getting from drawing cards. common means 5
points, rare means 10 points, and legendary means 20 points. The main part of
this page is to have images of the reward with the credit it equals to right
below it, there will be three reward in a row and I will probably put up 6, I
will also manage the image.
