# Questions
## 15-minute interactive discussion session.
• Conducted during your scheduled class time on the “non-exhibition day” in Week 11.
This interactive discussion session is free-form and is focused on assessing the “interactive
discussion” criterion in the rubric below, which is an individual mark. This session is intended to
mimic a discussion with an engineering manager, and the assessor will act on behalf of the
engineering manager for this session.
Hence:
• To demonstrate mastery of the subject content, all team members should be able to answer
questions individually on detailed aspects of the project (process or solution).
• To demonstrate active listening, all team members should, where appropriate, explicitly build upon
the answers and comments of others (team members and assessor) and invite and encourage
further discussion from others.
Some potential types of questions you can expect include:
a. The example questions for the exhibition session (see above) are also relevant here, with time
available to go into more detail.
b. Questions about next steps and further considerations, e.g.
- I see you have X functional here; what would you say is the next most critical thing to test/
ensure works?
- If your stakeholders wanted to take up your solution, what would you advise them to do next to
ensure the eventual solution would be a success?

# Shuyuan Gao
- How might we help both students and student organizations to shape more effective and sustainable component reuse practices?
# Amos
- What's the next version gonna look like?
# Linlin
- How might we let the students motivated in the long term? -- Interview result --> Having a reasonable reward system
# Yinlong
- What is learned? 

### Benefit all
we need to talk about how to benefit all stakeholders -- TCS staff, Unimelb, students.
the students get coupons or stuffs, they have long term goals and short term coupons.

unimelb can reduce the stockings on resuable e-waste such as monitors by putting them as the prize, that also reduces the money they put in the project, less money paid to house of cards and unimelb canteen, because of that.

TCS staff can reduce their budget on ordering components and that budget reduced can be paid to the staffs as additional salary on their workload.
